# Simulation and Scientific Computing 2
## Assignment 4 - Your very own wind tunnel simulator using the Lattice Boltzmann method

### 1. Compilation
The Makefile shipping with this programm requires the _lbm.cpp_ to be in the same folder as the Makefile when calling `make`.

### 2. Execution
_usage_: `./lbm params.dat`
- `params.dat` is the file to specify the parameters for the wind tunnel simulation.

The results are written into vtk-files in the same folder as the programm.

### 3. Team
This programm was developed by the students:
- Sebastian Eckl (xi07hura)
- Lukas Rosteck (ef88ygut)
- Patrik RÃ¡c (uh07ugar)
