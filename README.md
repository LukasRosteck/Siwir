# Simulation and Scientific Computing 2
## Assignment 4 - Your very own wind tunnel simulator using the Lattice Boltzmann method

### 1. Compilation
The Makefile shipping with this programm requires the _lbm.cpp_ , the _cmdparser.cpp_ and the _cmdparser.h_ to be in the same folder as the Makefile when calling `make`.
The _cmdparser_ was taken from the lecture "Systemprogrammierung" and is not an original work from the team.

### 2. Execution
_usage_: `to be defined`

### 3. Team
This programm was developed by the students:
- Sebastian Eckl (xi07hura)
- Lukas Rosteck (ef88ygut)
- Patrik RÃ¡c (uh07ugar)
